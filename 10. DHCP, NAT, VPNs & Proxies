* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
----------------------------------------
- Every coputer on a mordern TCP/IP network needs to have 4 thing configured:
1. IP address
2. Subnet mask for the local network
3. Gateway
4. Name server

- Configuring 100s of them is a tedious task -  Subnet mask for the local network, Gateway, Name server are almst the same for the nodes on a network;
- IP address needs to be different on every node on the network;
- This is where DHCP is important;

* DHCP - An application layer protocol that automates the configuration process of hosts on a network;
    - With DHCP a machine queries a DHCP server when the computer connects to the network and receives all the network configurations in one go;
    - For Gateways and routers static IP address are iportant and need to be known to all clients on the network;
