* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
----------------------------------------
- Every coputer on a mordern TCP/IP network needs to have 4 thing configured:
1. IP address
2. Subnet mask for the local network
3. Gateway
4. Name server

- Configuring 100s of them is a tedious task -  Subnet mask for the local network, Gateway, Name server are almst the same for the nodes on a network;
- IP address needs to be different on every node on the network;
- This is where DHCP is important;

* DHCP - An application layer protocol that automates the configuration process of hosts on a network;
    - With DHCP a machine queries a DHCP server when the computer connects to the network and receives all the network configurations in one go;
    - For Gateways and routers static IP address are important and need to be known to all clients on the network;
    
* DHCP ways of operation:
--------------------------
1. Dynamic allocation - A range of IP addresses are set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they                         request one;  There the IP of a system can be different everytime it connects to the network;

2. Automatic allocation - A range of IP addresses are set aside for assignmnet purpose; Here the DHCP tracks the assignment numbers                                   assigned to a host device and ensures to assign the same IP to the same machine;

3. Fixed allocation - Requires a manually specified list of MAC address and their corresponding IPs; MAC address and IP addressing mapping                       and lookup; If the MAC address is not available the DHCP server will fall back to automatic or dynamic allocation;
