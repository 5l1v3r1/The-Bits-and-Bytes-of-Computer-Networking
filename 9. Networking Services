* Name Resolution
------------------
* DNS
---------
-> MAC address - 48-bit binary numbers - written out in 6 grouping of 2 hexadecimal digits;
-> Remembering numbers is a tedious task than words.

-> DNS - Domain Name System - A global and highly distributed network service that resolves strings of letters into IP addresses for you.

-> Example for a weather website - IP address - 184.29.131.121 while the Domain name is - www.Weather.com - easier to remember the domain name;
-> The IP address for a domain name can also change all the time - in case of administrative changes, movements of the data centers;
-> The Domain name - The term we use for something that can be resolved by DNS;
-> DNS provides geographical data utlilty by enabling clients to gather data from servers that are collated, New Delhi server -> New Delhi, New york -> New York clients; Cause of the global structure DNS lets organizations decide if youre in the region resolve the domain name to this IP.


* Name Resolution
-------------------
-> The many steps of Name Resolution
-------------------------------------
 Name Resolution - The process of using a DNS system to convert Domain names into IP addresses; 
 - MAC address are hoardcoded to the hardware components;
 
* 4 Things that must be configured for a host to operate on a network in an expected way in standard modern networking are:
---------------------
 1. IP address
 2. Subnet mask
 3. Gateway for a host
 4. DNS server
 
 * 5 types of DNS servers:
 ----------------------------
 1. Caching name servers - Purpose is to store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time;
 2. Recursive name servers - Purpose is to store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time; Perform full DNS reolution requests;
 3. Root name servers
 4. TLD name servers
 5. Authoritative name servers
 
 ->  All domain names in the global DNS system have a TTL/ time to live;
 - Time to Live - (TTL) - A value, in seconds, that can be configured by the owner of a domain name for how long a name server is allowed to cache an entry before it should discard it and perform a full resolution again;
 
 Local Recursive server performs a full recursive resolution
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 1. Contact a root named server; There are 13 Root name servers/ 13 authorities that provide root name lookups as service - responsible for directing queries towards appropriate TLD name servers. They are distributed across the globe via anycast;
   * Anycast - A technique that is used to route traffic to different destination depending on factors like location, congestion, or                    link health;
 
 2. The root servers will respond to a DNS lookup with TLD(Top-level domain - Last part of any domain name - .com/.org/.edu, etc) name server that should be queried;
 3. For each TLD there is a TLD name server / global distribution;
 4. The TLD servers will respond again with a redirect, informing the computer performing the name lookup with what authoritative name server to contact;
 5. The DNS lookup could be redirected at the authoriative server for the respective domain name;
 6. The authoritative server would finally provide the actual IP of the server in question;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* DNS and UDP
---------------
-> DNS is an example of an application layer service that uses UDP for the transport layer instead of TCP;
-> UDP is connectionless - there is no setup or teardown of a connection;
